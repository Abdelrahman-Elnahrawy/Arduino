📛 Project Name:
ESP8266 GPIO Output Test

📝 Description:
Simple GPIO test sketch
for the ESP8266 module.

Multiple GPIO pins are
configured as outputs
and toggled together.

Used to verify pin
functionality, wiring,
LEDs, or relays.

⚙️ How It Works:
- 🔧 Set GPIO pins as OUTPUT
- ⬇️ Drive all pins LOW
- ⏱️ Wait 1 second
- ⬆️ Drive all pins HIGH
- ⏱️ Wait 2 seconds
- 🔁 Repeat forever

💡 Notes:
Active-low LEDs turn ON
when the pin is LOW.

✨ Features:
- 🧪 Multi-pin GPIO test
- 💡 Simple blink pattern
- 🚀 Hardware bring-up tool
- 📦 No extra libraries

🎯 Typical Uses:
- 🔌 ESP8266 pin testing
- 💡 LED / relay testing
- 🧰 Board verification
- 🗺️ GPIO mapping check
